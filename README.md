## Use Of A.I in Mental health
The rise of A. I can be seen in many fields and it had shown great results. 
so why not merge A. I with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and increase the access to mental healthcare especially In a country like India where we have very less regard for mental health also have very less mental health doctors.

The World Health Organization, in 2019, had estimated that 7.5% of Indians were affected by mental health disorders. This number would likely go up significantly because of the pandemic.
In a country with a deep mental health crisis, and with only above two mental health beds for every 1,00,000 population, mental health social workers, therapists and counsellors become a significant bridge in community health.

Using this kind of bot we can deploy these in mobile phones or websites and may be able to provide mental healthcare access in remote areas or to anybody who is ashamed of society to go to the doctor. Increasing awareness about mental health would be great and AISHIKA can help by making access more flexible.
